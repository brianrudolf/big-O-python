# big-O-python
This project assesses the time complexity of various built in Python functions. The program will display a plot of the time to run a function vs the size of the input, and compares that against some common Big O approximate times. The common times are O(n<sup>2</sup>), O(n * log(n)), O(n), and O(log(n)).
